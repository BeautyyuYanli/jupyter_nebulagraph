## Installation

`jupyter_nebulagraph` should be installed via pip.

```bash
pip install jupyter_nebulagraph

> Note: if you are doing this in a Jupyter Notebook, you can use the `!` or `%` prefix to run shell commands directly in the notebook.

```bash
%pip install jupyter_nebulagraph
```

## Load it in Jupyter Notebook or iPython

In each Jupyter Notebook or iPython environment, you need to load the extension before using it.

```python
%load_ext ngql
```
